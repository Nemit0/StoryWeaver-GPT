# Simple demonstration of using cuda inside a docker container

This is a simple demonstration of using cuda inside a docker container. The docker container is based on the official nvidia/cuda image, and cuda version is set as 12.2

The image can be changed on both Dockerfile and docker-compose to fit the cuda version you want to use. The images are listed here: [https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda)
